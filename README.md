# class-projects
collection of classnotes, and class projects from MOOCs I took.

Data Visualization Class [Note](https://github.com/worasom/class-projects/blob/master/data_vis.ipynb)

    * Customizing 1D plots: apply ggplot style, reset style to default, add arrow to annotate a graph, 
    rotate axis, legend
    * Plotting 2D arrays: contour plot, 2d histrogram, plot images, 
    histrogram and cumulative distribution function of a gray scale image, 
    Equalizing an image histogram, Extracting bivariate histograms from a color image.
    * Statistical plots with Seaborn: lmplot, residplot, regplot, jointplot, hue, 
    violinplot, striplot, swamplot, pairplot, heatmap
    * Analyzing time series: plot data with datetime index, multiple time slices, inset view

Interactive Visualization with Bokeh [note](https://github.com/worasom/class-projects/blob/master/bokeh_note.ipynb)

    * Basics Bokeh: maker options, drawing geometrical shape using patch(), 
    plotting pandas dataframe in bokeh, box_select tool, Hover tool, Colormap
    * Building interactive apps with Bokeh: connet Bokeh widgets to a python code.  
    For example, generate fit after user select a plot, or change plotting data from a selection panel. 
    Widget options include slider, select (dropdown), button etc.
    
Time Series Analysis
   * Merging Time Series With Different Dates
   * Correlation, autocorrelation function
   * Linear Regression 
   * Random Walk
   * Stationarity, autoregressive (AR) Models
   * Moving Average (MA) Model
   * ARMA model
   * Cointegration Models
    
Machine Learning for Time Series Data in Python
   * Classification heartbeat sounds: feature engineering and LinearSVC 
   * Regression stock prices
   * Feature engineer time series data: envelope, tempogram, spectrogram, bandwidths, centroids
   * Auto-regressive models 
   * cross-validating time series data
   * How to work with non-stationary data, and assesting model stability 
   
MongoDB
    * Query documents and subdocuments, Counting Documents
    * Survey Distinct Values with filters, element match operator 
    * Filter with Regular Expressions
    * MongoDB Projection
    * Sort search result: post query sort and in-query sort 
    * Indexes in MongoDB
    * Limits and Skips search 
    * aggregation
