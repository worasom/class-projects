# Class Projects/Notes
collection of classnotes, and class projects from MOOCs I took.

## Data Visualization Class [notebook](https://github.com/worasom/class-projects/blob/master/data_vis.ipynb)

- Customizing 1D plots: apply ggplot style, reset style to default, add arrow to annotate a graph, 
    rotate axis, legend
- Plotting 2D arrays: contour plot, 2d histrogram, plot images, 
    histrogram and cumulative distribution function of a gray scale image, 
    Equalizing an image histogram, Extracting bivariate histograms from a color image.
- Statistical plots with Seaborn: lmplot, residplot, regplot, jointplot, hue, 
    violinplot, striplot, swamplot, pairplot, heatmap
- Analyzing time series: plot data with datetime index, multiple time slices, inset view

## Interactive Visualization with Bokeh [notebook](https://github.com/worasom/class-projects/blob/master/bokeh_note.ipynb)

- Basics Bokeh: maker options, drawing geometrical shape using patch(), 
    plotting pandas dataframe in bokeh, box_select tool, Hover tool, Colormap
- Building interactive apps with Bokeh: connet Bokeh widgets to a python code.  
    For example, generate fit after user select a plot, or change plotting data from a selection panel. 
    Widget options include slider, select (dropdown), button etc.
    
## Time Series Analysis [notebook](https://github.com/worasom/class-projects/blob/master/time-series-anlysis.ipynb)

- Merging Time Series With Different Dates
- Correlation, autocorrelation function
- Linear Regression 
- Random Walk
- Stationarity, autoregressive (AR) Models
- Moving Average (MA) Model
- ARMA model
- Cointegration Models
- A Multivariate Time Series
    
## Machine Learning for Time Series Data in Python [notebook](https://github.com/worasom/class-projects/blob/master/ml4time_series.ipynb)

- Classification heartbeat sounds: feature engineering and LinearSVC 
- Regression stock prices
- Feature engineer time series data: envelope, tempogram, spectrogram, bandwidths, centroids
- Auto-regressive models 
- cross-validating time series data
- How to work with non-stationary data, and assesting model stability 

## Statistic and A/B Testing

- Analyzed data from the popular mobile game, Cookie Cats. Used bootstrap analysis to compare effectiveness of time pause at level 30 and 40 toward user retention [notebook](https://github.com/worasom/class-projects/blob/master/cookie_cats.ipynb)
